                <p class="badu">How to segment a list in Mailchimp</p>
                <p class="chotu">Once you begin the process of creating a segment in Mailchimp, you’ll be able to choose which audience you’d like to segment. While we recommend maintaining only a single audience, you can choose your preferred audience to segment if you have multiple.</p>

                <p class="badu">How to send emails to a segment in Mailchimp</p>
                <p class="chotu">Email marketing segmentation can be a great way to send tailored messages to a targeted group of customers.

                <p class="badu">What is behavioral segmentation in marketing?</p>
                <p class="chotu">In marketing, behavioral segmentation describes the process of dividing customers into groups based on their behavior patterns and actions taken. Using segmentation marketing software, marketers can quickly and easily segment their audience to gain valuable insights and improve future marketing campaigns.</p>
            <hr>
                <p class="badu">What is segmentation in email marketing?</p>
                <p class="chotu">Segmentation in email marketing is when a company divides the subscribers on their email list into smaller groups based on factors such as actions taken, behavior patterns, interests, age, location, and more. With email marketing segmentation tools like Mailchimp, marketers can easily manage and segment their audience based on a variety of crucial factors. This enables you to develop more sophisticated and personalized email marketing campaigns that connect with your audience.</p>
            <hr>
                <p class="badu">Why does segmentation matter in email marketing?</p>
                <p class="chotu">By leveraging customer segmentation tools, marketers can create better email marketing campaigns that more effectively appeal to shoppers. After all, everyone is different, so sending generic marketing emails that try to appeal to every single subscriber on your email list is rarely going to be an effective strategy. Segmenting your audience makes it easier to create personalized emails and improve conversions.

                    Additionally, segmentation tools can help companies market to shoppers who are in different stages of the sales cycle. Through email marketing segmentation, you can easily send welcome emails to new subscribers, abandoned cart emails to hesitant shoppers, and follow-up emails to recent customers.</p>
